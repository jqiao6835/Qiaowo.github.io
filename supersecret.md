Woah there! 
<br>How did you get here?? :00 
<br>This place is top secret!! How did you even get in here??
<br>It's practically impossible to see this!!
<br>Someone must've told you about this place.....ü§î
<br> Hmmmm...I wonder who told you about this secret easter egg üëÄ
<br>You're eyes are so sharp!!üëÄ 
<br>Anyways... since ur here.. I just wanted to tell you that you're really amazing and my FAVOURITE person in the world ;3
<br>I've made so many countless beautiful memories that I'll never forget‚ù§Ô∏è
<br>Never forget that I love and care about you‚ù§Ô∏è
<br>We may be far from each other and I know that sometimes I might not have much time to spend with you on Sky or that sometimes you're really tired from work and aren't able to stay too long. I hope that one day we wont be so far from each other and maybe even be able to see each other much more often ;)
<br>But believe me when I say that the effort you put into wanting to be with me even just for a second, especially when you're tired, really means everything to me. Sometimes it's really hard for me to express into words how much you mean to me and how truely touched I am by the small things you do for me. They might just be small actions or small words of encouragement or even just being in your presence really makes me feel blessed to have met you. 
<br>Everytime I'm with you I feel super happy and just aaaaaaa ~~I'm so happy to see you~~üò≠
<br>I really truly feel safe with you and I really feel safe sharing a lot of personal things with you that I have never really told anyone or felt comfortable about talking about. It really surprises me everytime you invite me to rant XD I really do hope I'm not bothersome with the rants I go on.üòÖ (Thanks for putting up with them, I tend to go off track and my thoughts go everywhere which often leads to tangents)
<br>But thank you from the bottom of my heartüíñ. Having someone be willing to listen to me, especially someone really special to me, really means the world to me. I hope that I also in return make you feel safe sharing certain things with me, I really do care about you and want to help you through things if you feel burdened at times. I know sometimes it's difficult to share certain details or specifics, and if you feel like you don't want to tell me certain things that's ok with me too. I will 100% respect your boundaries. However you still need to tell me if you're not feeling well or if you're bothered or if you just need to vent stuff to me! It's goo to vent out your fustration sometimes, and I'm 100% down to listen to any ranting you have.üòä 
<br>Never forget that I'll stick by you and be your sidekick and knight.üòå I'll be there to beef with anyone that messes with you or annoys you, cuz if they wanna have a go at you, they'll have to get thru me and I am very sus so they def wouldn't be able to handle me.    
<br>Also! You might not know this but being affectionate is actually smth that I developed while spending time with you. It isn't really a thing in Asian culture to be that affectionate (it's quite taboo) even with people you are close with. I've never really hugged anyone but my friends and very rarely my family. Though it's probably a European thing for people to be so friendly and affectionate. At first, it felt a lot like a foreign concept to me? Constantly hugging people and giving kisses. But for some reason I feel comfortable doing it with you and it makes me really happy that we call each other zhu zhu and give each other gn kisses, which imo is super adorable.üôà‚ù§Ô∏è
<br>I am truly truly so blessed and thankful to have you in my lifeü•∞
<br>I really hope we meet one day so I can be able to hug you in personüòä
<br> Anyways sorry for this essay long thingy, I just really wanted to say this to you in proper written text. :)
<br>And always remember, I love you and care so much about you, I'll always have your back, and you are so incredibly special and unique to me. You're irreplaceable.‚ù§Ô∏è
<br>So again, truly from the bottom of my heart. I love you so much. Thank you for everything Daniel zhu zhu.‚ù§Ô∏è
