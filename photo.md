*Note: This gallery features a lot of Mayya photos because Mayya is a specimen that we all are currently in the process of documenting. We don't know much about what s Mayya is or what it is capable of...but from what we have captured in our investigation....it seems dangerous. Beware of Mayyas in this photo gallery. You have been warned.

>I used to go to school super early like around 7 am to just study and review or sleep before classes started. usually no one is at school yet except janitors. But one day I come in and the whole school is dark and I got confused cuz I thought maybe there wasn't school that day but I was sure that there was and so I just sat in the caf where I normally sit and turns out, there was a power outage, whihc sometimes happens int he winter time if it get's too snowy/icy. But yeah I took the pic cuz it felt so surreal cuz no one was there and it was just me in this pitch black school foyer place. (It was also really cool tho which is why I also decided to take a pic LOL)
