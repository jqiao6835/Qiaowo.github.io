*Note: This gallery features a lot of Mayya photos because Mayya is a specimen that we all are currently in the process of documenting. We don't know much about what s Mayya is or what it is capable of...but from what we have captured in our investigation....it seems dangerous. Beware of Mayyas in this photo gallery. You have been warned.
